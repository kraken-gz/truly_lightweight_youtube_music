Linux:

find path:
```locate youtube.luac```



copy content od ```youtube.7z``` in that location (which you found) replacing it




Windows:

Rename the downloaded youtube.lua file to youtube.luac

Now copy this file and paste it to C:\Program Files (x86)\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\playlist\


---------------

to stream youtube music, via vlc-a , you need to set this up first. (this written above)

and then

Media > Open Capture Device > Network

put a link from the music
i ```Play```

plays video and audio

to be just sound, go to:

Video > Video track > Disable

---------------

HERE , VLC and audio controller consumes only 9.2% CPU 
indeed, this is lightweight and efficient
